# Displaced Leptons BDT

This BDT takes in SUSY selectron pair production MC as signal, and ATLAS data from 2022 as background. The goal is to use measured variables from the ATLAS tracker and calorimeter to distinguish signal reconstructed by ATLAS as electrons and photons from background electron and photons.
